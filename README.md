Simple gravity simulator where particles follow the mouse. Colour changes depending on the force acting on the particle (Red -> Strong and Green -> Weak).

## Usage
To run click play on the top left.

The mouse is the attractor, therefore all particles will move towards it. You can move the mouse around the screen and even increase the number of particles on screen.

**NOTE**: This was code I produced during the bootcamp session in University. Expect that as you increase the number of particles, the performance will degrade drastically.
